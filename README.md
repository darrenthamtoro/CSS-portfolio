# CSS-portfolio
HOMEWORK 2
In this project, we have to make a website from scratch with html and CSS codes. The website should look like the website that is given, with all the information inside it. In my code, I had difficulties with the spacings for the CSS code, I spent a lot of time researching, along with the help of my tutor to solve this problem.
